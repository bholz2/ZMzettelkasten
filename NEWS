### 2008-04-10 - Version 0.40
The first version in English


### 2008-03-31 - Version 0.39

this is the first release after 0.35
The program is completely rewritten/ported to a Gnome Application.
With that a lot of new features are implemented which I do not want to
list in detail.

Basically the Editor Window is based now on the GtkSourceView which supports
features like spell checking, undo - redo and so on.

Additionally the Autor- and Stichwort (like keyword or catchword) Window and
 some smaller support windows "Preferences" and "File Information"
Windows where implemented.

Originally I planed to release this version as 0.40 ... but also 0.40 should
be a release with multi lingual support.
